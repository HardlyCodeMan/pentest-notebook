# On Disk

### Packers

Simply used to repack and compress the binary, resulting a smaller and functionally equivalent binary. This gives the file a new signature which may evade older AV software but not more modern ones.

### Obfuscators

Generally mutate/reorganise the binary making it difficult to reverse engineer through renaming functions and inserting irrelevant or "dead code". More commonly used to protect IP, sometimes effective against signature based AV.

### Crypters

Cryptographically altering the code and including a decryption code stub to restore the original code on execution in memory leaving the disk based file still encrypted. One of the most effective AV evasion techniques.
