# Tunnelling DPI

Utilising HTTPTunnel [https://github.com/larsbrinkhoff/httptunnel](https://github.com/larsbrinkhoff/httptunnel)

Start a ssh [local port forward](page-6.md#linux-client) from the Linux client to tunnel through.

Start the HTTPTunnel server on the Linux client

```
user@debian~:$ hts --forward-port localhost:<port forward port> <listen port>
```

Start the HTTPTunnel client on the attack machine

```
kali@kali~:$ htc --forward-port <port> <linux client ip>:<linux client listen port>
```

Port forwarding can be checked with ss

```
kali@kali~:$ ss -antp | grep "<port>"
```
