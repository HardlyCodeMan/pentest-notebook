# Powershell

#### Loading Modules

```
PS C:\> . C:\Temp\somefile.ps1

PS C:\> Import-Module C:\Temp\somefile.ps1
```

#### Display Module Commands

```
PS C:\> Get-Commands -Module <module name>
```

#### Execution Policy

Execution policy is not a security measure, it is a method to prevent users from accidently executing scripts. Administrative access is not required to bypass the execution policy.

```
## simply start a powershell process with an execution policy bypass
C:\> powershell -ExecutionPolicy bypass

## commands are not bound by execution policy
C:\> powershell -c <command>

## again commands are not bound by execution policy
C:\> powershell -encodecommand

## set an environment variable
PS C:\> $env:PSEcecutionPolicyReference="bypass"
```
