# NTLM

NTLM is used then the client authenticates by IP to the server rather than hostname, or when the user attempts to authenticate to a hostname not registered to the domains DNS server.

Third party applications may also choose NTML for authentication.

1. Client - Calculate NTLM Hash of the users password
2. Client - Send Username to App Server
3. App Server - Responds to Client Username with Nonce
4. Client - Responds to App Server with NTML Hash Encrypted Nonce
5. App Server - Sends the Response (NTML Hash Encrypted Nonce), Username and Nonce to the Domain Controller (DC)
6. DC - Encrypts Nonce with it's own NTLM Hash of the Username and compares this to the Response
7. DC - Responds to App Server with authentication approval or denial dependant on the comparison (Step 6)
