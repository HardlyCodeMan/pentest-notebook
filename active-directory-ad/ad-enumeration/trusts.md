# Trusts



Trusted Domain Objects (TDOs) are a trust relationship between two domains or forests which allow users of one domain/forest to access recourses in the other domain/forest.

Automatic trust is within the same domain/forest - Parent-Child or Tree-Root

Established trust is with an external domain/forest

One-Way Trust direction is the opposite of the direction of access:\
Eg. An account is trusted by a resource to access it. \
\- The Direction of Trust is Resource -> Account. \
\- The Direction of Access is Account -> Resource.

Two-Way Trust is bidirectional trust and access.

Transitive Trust can be extended through intra-forest trust relationships such as parent-child.\
\- If A -> B and B -> C then through transitive trust, A -> C.\
\- Should C become compromised, B and A are also open to compromise though this transitive trust.

Non-Transitive is the default level of trust between two domains of different forests (an external trust).

Forest Trust is between two forest roots only, cannot be extended to a third forest (no implicit trust). Can me one-way, two-way and transitive or non-transitive.
