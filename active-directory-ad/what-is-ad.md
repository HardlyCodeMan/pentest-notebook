# What is AD

Active Directory (AD) is an implementation my Microsoft to enable user, computer, application and service control and authentication across a (generally) corporate network. The core component of an AD setup is the Domain Controller (DC).

The DC stores all information of the setup, and enforces rulesets across the Windows domain on which it is attached. It is generally setup and administrated by the network administrators through multiple levels of control.

Within a domain there are multiple objects, these objects may be users, computers, printers, security hardware, software applications running as services and more. To assist with ease of administration the groups of objects are often put into Organisational Units (OU) where rulesets are put in place to cover the objects of the OU, removing the need to setup each object individually, and allows for bulk updates/changes in group policy.

Each AD object contains multiple attributes eg. a user may have a first name, middle name, last name, username, password, email address.

AD has a critical dependence on the DNS service for internal domain routing, as a result the DC will typically host a DNS server for the domain it is a part.
