# IPv6 Attacks

IPv4 is generally in use for local networking, but IPv6 is enabled by default in Windows, allowing for another attack vector though DNS over IPv6 which is some what hidden as IPv6 generally isn't used or looked at.\
This allows for DNS spoofing (over IPv6) allowing for NTLM credential use via a LDAP relay.

#### Mitigations

Block IPv6 traffic at the firewall level and or disable IPv6 in the network adapter properties

Disable WPAD via group policy if not in use internally

Consider delegation of Administrative / Privileged users
