# IPv6 Attacks

IPv4 is generally in use for local networking, but IPv6 is enabled by default in Windows, allowing for another attack vector though DNS over IPv6 which is some what hidden as IPv6 generally isn't used or looked at.\
This allows for DNS spoofing (over IPv6) allowing for NTLM credential use via a LDAP relay.
